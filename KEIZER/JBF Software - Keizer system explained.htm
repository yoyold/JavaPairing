				<p>The Keizer system is well known in the Netherlands and in Belgium, but is still    hardly known in the rest of the world. This is pitiful because it is a very    nice competition system in many circumstances, especially for club competitions.</p>
<p>The system was developed in the late fifties by the chairman of a chess club    in Hengelo (Holland). His name was Keizer (which is the Dutch word for &ldquo;Emperor&rdquo;)    and the system has been named after him later. He found for his club that is    was very annoying that players who appeared on the club very well might not    be able to play, as there opponent did not show up. Round robin competitions    suffer from this problem. There are a fixed number of rounds. Everyone has to    play everyone else. If someone&rsquo;s opponent doesn&rsquo;t show up then he can&rsquo;t play.    If more opponents don&rsquo;t show up then a number of players may not be able to    play. They are forced to play blitz games or so. Another well-known problem    of Round Robin competitions is that very uninteresting games may be scheduled.    Usually a game between a 1900 rating player and a 1400 rated opponent is not    really interesting.</p>
<p>Swiss pairing systems can be used to work around these problems but they have    some problems as well. Usually you are not allowed to play the same opponent    twice (although no-one will really stop you from doing so). Furthermore Swiss    is complex to pair and the scoring has some drawbacks.&nbsp; They tend to be pretty    leveling. Someone can play bad in a number of rounds, can recover against a    number of weak opponents en with a sprint in the final rounds he can finish    on a nice position anyway. Especially when the number of rounds is high (more    than 10) then this is an important drawback of Swiss.</p>
<p>So Keizer came up with a system which handles these problems well &ndash; or at least    better. Important ideas behind Keizer are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Not everyone will play anyone else during the tournament. Maybe because      the number of participants exceed (by far) the number of playing rounds. Or      because this results in more interesting games.</li>
    <li>Everyone will be able in each playing round, except one if the number of      available players is odd.</li>
    <li>A win against a strong opponent scores more than a win against a weak opponent.</li>
    <li>Multiple plays between two players may be allowed.</li>
    <li>Every play is supposed to be between two nearly equally strong players.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every player in a Keizer competition will have a value. The highest value goes    to the top ranked player; the second highest value goes to the second ranked    player, and so on. Usually the value of the top ranked player is approximately    three times the value of the lowest ranked player. Each next player has a value    one less than the previous one. For instance: If a competition has 35 players    then a nice value would be 50 for the top ranked player. The bottom ranked player    would consequently have a value of 16.</p>
<p>A player who beats an opponent will score the value of this opponent. A player    who draws someone else gets half of the value of the opponent. A player who    loses gets 0 points.</p>
<p>Pairing of a Keizer competition basically is very simple. The top ranked available    player is paired to the second ranked available player. The third ranked player    is paired to the forth, and so on. However, many clubs prefer to have a number    of exceptions on this. For instance when two players have met in some round    then they should not meet again in the next X rounds. Also it may be required    that players should not play with the same color more than two times in a row;    or that the color balance of any player may not exceed +2 or -2. But these are    variations which are not really endorsed by the original Keizer system. Just    many clubs prefer to apply them.</p>
<p>Color allocation is done in a way that the color preference of the player with    a color balance most distant to zero is granted. If two players have the same    color balance then the player who has played the most successive games with    the same color will now play with the other color. If this criterion ties too    then the history is checked. Where a change in color sequence occurs there the    colors will be opposite to the color allocation of that round. If this also    ties then various color allocation rules may be used: this is not fixed in Keizer.</p>
<p>Absences don&rsquo;t always score 0 points in Keizer. If an absence should score    0 then the absent player would drop a lot on the ranking and would probably    meet a much weaker player in the next. This is not nice for both of them. Therefore    absences are usually rewarded with 1/3 of the players own value. Sometimes players    can not play because they are occupied on behalf of the club. For instance:    they have to play with a club team against another club. Then 1/3 of the player&rsquo;s    value would be a small reward for their effort. Usually they will be rewarded    with 2/3 of their own value. In some cases clubs prefer to take into account    the result of a club match. Then the opponent players are rewarded a virtual    value, and the result of the club players is multiplied with these virtual values,    depending of winning, drawing or losing. Usually the virtual value of the top    board is higher than the virtual value of the lower boards.</p>
<p>The values of the players are recalculated after each round. Then the total    score is recalculated from scratch. Suppose John beat Jim in one of the first    rounds. Jim had a value of 50 so John received 50 points. But in the next rounds    Jim plays poor and the drops in the ranking. His value has now become 40. Then    in the ranking the result of John earlier will no longer be 50 points but 40    instead. The idea behind is that Jim appears not to be as strong as assumed    earlier, and the performance of John is not as great as was assumed earlier.    Therefore Johns score is corrected after all. If Jim recovers and after some    more rounds his value has become 45, then Johns score for his earlier win against    Jim will become 45 at that point; etcetera.</p>
<p>For calculating the ranking the scores of each round are added. In addition    to that, each player gets a &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; of one time his own value. Then the player    with the highest score is ranked first.</p>
<p>Below is a small example, taken from the document Keizer wrote about his system.    The initial ranking is:</p>
<pre>1.  Johnson      50<br />2.  Petersen     49<br />3.  Baker        48<br />4.  Butcher      47<br />5.  Carter       46<br />6.  Harrison     45<br />7.  Smith        44<br />8.  Higgins      43<br />9.  White        42<br />10. Brown        41</pre>
<p>Results of the first round:</p>
<pre>Johnson    Petersen     1-0<br />Baker      Butcher      &frac12;-&frac12;<br />Carter     Harrison     0-1<br />Smith      Higgins      &frac12;-&frac12;<br />White      Brown        0-1</pre>
<p>Ranking after round 1:</p>
<pre>1.  Johnson      50+49=99<br />2.  Harrison     45+46=91<br />3.  Brown        41+42=83<br />4.  Baker        48+23&frac12;=71&frac12;<br />5.  Butcher      47+24=71<br />6.  Smith        44+21&frac12;=65&frac12;<br />7.  Higgins      43+22=65<br />8.  Petersen     49+0=49<br />9.  Carter       46+0=46<br />10. White        42+0=42</pre>
<p>The pairing for the second round would be:</p>
<pre>Harrison   Johnson      1-0<br />Brown      Baker        1-0<br />Butcher    Smith        &frac12;-&frac12;<br />Higgins    Petersen     0-1<br />Carter     White        &frac12;-&frac12;</pre>
<p>Now for the ranking the values are related to the ranking after the previous    round. So Petersen&rsquo;s value no longer is 49 but it is 43, which is the value    for the eighth position. This means that Johnson's win in the first round no    longer scores 49 points but only 43.</p>
<pre>1.  Harrison     49+42+50=141<br />2.  Brown        48+41+47=136<br />3.  Johnson      50+43+0=93<br />4.  Butcher      46+23&frac12;+22&frac12;=92<br />5.  Smith        45+22+23=90<br />6.  Petersen     43+0+44=87<br />7.  Baker        47+23+0=70<br />8.  Higgins      44+22&frac12;+0=66&frac12;<br />9.  Carter       42+0+20&frac12;=62&frac12;<br />10. White        41+0+21=62</pre>
<p>For the ranking of the next round, Harrison&rsquo;s value will be 50, and White&rsquo;s    value will be 41. Etcetera.</p>			</td>
